# Talkie
Open source project that aims to provide text, video and audio communication written in Rust. Main goals are rich configuration possibilities, crossplatform native app experience. The result is self-hosting backend server with text based config (maybe web management interface as well). The client side is planned to have web interface

# This project at this stage is mostly study project that has potential to convert into something more serious
